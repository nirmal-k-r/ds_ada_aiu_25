# To do (Homework)



# objectives
 - Study how occupation categories vary with age and gender 
 - Assess the dependence (>5) of It professionals on coffee (coffee_intake)


# sub-objectives (understanding the dataset)
 - Compare gender balance across the dataset.
 - Study correlations between stress and sleep quality, caffeine, physical activity.
 - Compare stress levels across occupations.
 - assess whether high caffeine + poor sleep participants exhibit higher stress or health issues


# data cleaning
 - filter relevant columns
 - rename columns to meaningful names
 - handle null values
 - encoding
 - handlign outliers
 

# tips
 - separate label encoders
